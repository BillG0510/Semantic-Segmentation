# Semantic-Segmentation
Python
Semantic Segmentation(Python, Mxnet)
- Improved the FCN method basing on picture database VOC12
- Built network based on ResNet-18, used batch normalization, early stopping, dropout to modify the network
- Used convolutions to replace the fully connected layers and used transposed convolution for upsampling
- The accuracy is nearly 0.85 and the things in the picture can be correctly recognized by the computer
